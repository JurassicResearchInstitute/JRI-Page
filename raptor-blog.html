    <h2>Velociraptor: Partners in Prowess</h2>
    <span class="meta">Site Delta · Classified Notes</span>
    <img src="assets/velociraptor_blog.jpg" alt="T-Rex">
   <p>
      For decades, paleontologists believed that Velociraptors were solitary hunters, prowling the ancient landscapes alone in search of prey. However, research from the past seven years has completely overturned this assumption. Evidence now suggests that these cunning predators often paired up in twos, forming partnerships that complemented each other’s intelligence and abilities—much like a perfectly matched team.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before fully committing, these raptors went through what scientists cheekily call “The Flirtacious Period”. During this time, pairs engaged in playful and intricate behaviors, testing each other’s wit and compatibility. Only after successfully navigating this phase did they settle into long-term partnerships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once paired, Velociraptors were seen moving through their territories together, hunting in coordinated patterns, and even engaging in communal activities that would surprise many. Fossilized nesting sites hint at shared construction of elaborate “gardens” of flora and the placement of primitive bird feeders, seemingly designed to attract a particularly stunning species now nicknamed The Bish (Bishop).
    </p>
    <p>
        This remarkable discovery not only redefines our understanding of Velociraptor behavior but also serves as a charming reminder that partnership, playfulness, and cooperation have always been part of life—even in the most ferocious of species. Observing these ancient duos, it’s clear that the bonds formed during The Flirtacious Period laid the foundation for enduring connection, shared exploration, and a life of companionship in prehistoric times.
