    <h2>Mesosaurus: the Sea Puppy</h2>
    <span class="meta">Field Observation · JRI</span>
    <img src="assets/mesosaurus_blog.jpg" alt="T-Rex">
    <p>
      From the bones alone, we can of course tell that the male Mesosaurus held a very special place in the life of his mate. Among her, he was known as her “puppy” — loyal, attentive, and never too far from her side. Yet make no mistake: to anyone else, he was a fierce hound, quick to defend, quicker to react, and fully aware of his place in the prehistoric world.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes the male Mesosaurus remarkable is not his strength, but his freedom. With her, he was able to be entirely himself — bold, clumsy, cautious, brave — and still be loved without condition. We can tell this by the bones, which show a creature unburdened, unafraid, and strangely at peace in her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interestingly enough, the male Mesosaurus was known to be allergic to jellyfish and, despite his semi-aquatic nature, had a strong dislike for the open oceans. Tides would sometimes sweep him along unwillingly, a fact we can again confirm by the bones. And yet, when his mate ventured into deeper waters, he followed. Not because he loved the sea — but because he loved her. And sometimes, even in the Mesozoic era, that was reason enough.
